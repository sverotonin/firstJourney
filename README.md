# First Journey

A growing collection of beginner projects, starting with a To-Do List application, as I explore and develop my skills in web development. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Current Project

### To-Do List App

This initial project is a simple to-do list application, where users can add, mark, and delete tasks. Itâ€™s designed to help me practice JavaScript fundamentals, DOM manipulation, and local storage.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Quickly add new tasks to keep track of your to-dos.
- **Mark Complete**: Click on tasks to mark them as complete.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove completed or unwanted tasks.
- **Persistence**: Uses Local Storage to save tasks after refreshing.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sverotonin/firstJourney.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd firstJourney
    ```
3. Open `index.html` in your browser to use the app.

## Usage

1. Type a task into the input field and click "Add Task" to add it to the list.
2. Click on a task to mark it as complete. Completed tasks will appear crossed out.
3. Use the delete button to remove tasks from the list.

## Future Plans

As this is an evolving project, I plan to add more features and explore additional JavaScript projects, possibly expanding into new types of web applications.
